## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/asterisk-sendfax.git
   cd asterisk-sendfax
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Bash shell environment
- Asterisk PBX system (for testing)
- Ghostscript (`gs`)
- ImageMagick (`magick`/`convert`)
- Standard Unix tools (`sed`, `awk`, `fold`, `fmt`)

### Test Environment
For development and testing, you can use:
- A local Asterisk installation
- Docker container with Asterisk
- Virtual machine with Asterisk

### Configuration for Testing
Create a test configuration by copying the script and modifying the configuration section:
```bash
cp sendfax.sh sendfax-test.sh
# Edit configuration variables for your test environment
```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Types of Contributions Welcome
- üêõ **Bug fixes** - Fix issues with existing functionality
- ‚ú® **New features** - Add new capabilities or options
- üìñ **Documentation** - Improve README, add examples, code comments
- üé® **Code improvements** - Refactor, optimize, or clean up code
- üß™ **Tests** - Add test cases or improve testing coverage
- üöÄ **Performance** - Optimize PostScript generation or text processing

### What We're Looking For
- Improvements to error handling and validation
- Support for additional Asterisk configurations
- Enhanced PostScript/PDF processing
- Better internationalization support
- Additional output formats
- Integration with other fax systems
- Performance optimizations

## Code Style

### Bash Script Standards
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Follow [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html) principles
- Use meaningful variable names with clear prefixes
- Add comments for complex logic sections
- Include function documentation

### Example Code Style
```bash
# Good: Clear function with documentation
generate_coversheet() {
    local recipient_number="$1"
    local recipient_name="$2"
    local subject="$3"
    local message="$4"
    local priority="$5"
    
    # Process recipient name if provided
    if [[ "$recipient_name" == *"<"*">" ]]; then
        # Extract name from "Name <phone>" format
        recipient_display=$(echo "$recipient_name" | sed 's/<[^>]*>//' | sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//;s/[[:space:]]*$//')
    else
        recipient_display="$recipient_number"
    fi
    
    # Generate PostScript content
    cat > "$COVERSHEET_FILE" << EOF
    %!PS-Adobe-3.0
    % Coversheet generation logic here
EOF
}
```

### Variable Naming Conventions
- `ALL_CAPS` for configuration constants
- `snake_case` for local variables
- `TEMP_FILE` patterns for temporary files
- Clear prefixes for related variables (`FAX_`, `COVER_`, etc.)

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
Before submitting a pull request, please test:

1. **Basic functionality**:
   - [ ] Simple phone number transmission
   - [ ] Named recipient format
   - [ ] With and without coversheet
   - [ ] Different priority levels

2. **Edge cases**:
   - [ ] Very long messages (>18 lines)
   - [ ] Special characters in names
   - [ ] International phone formats
   - [ ] Empty/minimal parameters

3. **Error conditions**:
   - [ ] Invalid phone numbers
   - [ ] Missing PDF files
   - [ ] Invalid priority levels
   - [ ] Insufficient permissions

### Test Script Example
Create comprehensive test cases:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-sendfax.sh - Basic test suite

echo "Testing basic transmission..."
./sendfax.sh 5551234567 test.pdf "Test" "Basic test message"

echo "Testing named recipient..."
./sendfax.sh "John Doe <5551234567>" test.pdf "Test" "Named recipient test"

echo "Testing without coversheet..."
./sendfax.sh --nocover 5551234567 test.pdf

# Add more test cases as needed
```
